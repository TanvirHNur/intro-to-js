// the var word is a key of js programming language. every programming language the 'var' is common
// so I w'll share five roles of writing variable
// 1. Reserve keywords in the programming language cannot be used
// 2.Space cannot be given for more than one word
// 3.No quotation or sign can be given
// 4.Notable issues in the case of multiple word variables
//                     1.The name must be meaningful.
//                     2.Write without space and
//                     3.The first letter of the next words will be the upper case
//                    4 . It can also be written with an under score between two words, but the system does not use much in JavaScript using Python or C.
//                     5.In special case all the words give upper case e
                    // 6.The first letter cannot be a number but can be from the second letter
